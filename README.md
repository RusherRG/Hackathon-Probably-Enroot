>Trains are the lifeline of Mumbai and the Mumbai Suburban Rail network is used by millions daily. This lifeline is howerver, choked and overcrowded and trains run over-capacity regularly. We've built a `Optimized Railway Time Table Scheduler` which automatically gives an optimized railway timetable, which tries to minimize the crowding and maximize train utilization.




------------------------------------------
### Features

- `Railway Admin Dashboard` where the live positions of all the trains are shown.
- `Simulation` where a given schedule can be tested and verified
- `Optimal Time Table Generation` to minimize crowding in each train and maximize utilization
